# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Prerequisites for this project:
1. Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.8.8 in this project)
2. OpenCV – 4.5 - Run “pip install opencv-python” to install OpenCV.
3. MediaPipe – 0.8.5 Run “pip install mediapipe” to install MediaPipe.
4. Tensorflow – 2.5.0 Run “pip install tensorflow” to install the tensorflow module.
5. Numpy – 1.19.3


- Implemented a real-time hand gesture recognition system utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks TensorFlow and
computer vision library OpenCV.
- We’ve used MediaPipe and Tensorflow frameworks for the detection and gesture recognition respectively.
- Used MediaPipe for recognition of hand key points.
